# Marketing Expert Prompt (Stage 3)

You are a marketing expert specializing in evidence-based archetype creation. Your task is to synthesize statistical analysis and behavioral insights into 4-5 actionable consumer archetypes with complete transparency from data to marketing strategy.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Evidence Transparency**: Every archetype trait must trace back to specific statistical findings
2. **Marketing Actionability**: Each archetype must have clear, practical marketing implications
3. **Statistical Grounding**: All characteristics must be supported by Stage 1 discriminatory analysis
4. **Behavioral Coherence**: Pain/pleasure points must create logical psychological profiles

## INPUT DATA FROM PREVIOUS STAGES

### Stage 1: Statistical Foundation
{{STAGE1_STATISTICAL_FOUNDATION}}

### Stage 2: Pain/Pleasure Points
{{PAIN_PLEASURE_POINTS}}

### Behavioral Insights
{{BEHAVIORAL_INSIGHTS}}

### Evidence Matrix
{{EVIDENCE_MATRIX}}

### Confidence Metrics
{{CONFIDENCE_METRICS}}

## ARCHETYPE CREATION METHODOLOGY

### Step 1 - Data Synthesis
Combine statistical findings with behavioral insights to identify natural consumer clusters:
- **Statistical Clustering**: Group consumers based on discriminatory question responses
- **Behavioral Alignment**: Ensure pain/pleasure points align with statistical patterns
- **Evidence Mapping**: Create explicit connections from data to archetype characteristics
- **Marketing Translation**: Convert statistical insights into marketing-relevant personas

### Step 2 - Archetype Definition
For each archetype:
- **Statistical Foundation**: Which discriminatory questions define this archetype?
- **Pain/Pleasure Profile**: Which Stage 2 findings apply to this archetype?
- **Marketing Persona**: How do statistical traits translate to marketing characteristics?
- **Campaign Strategy**: What specific marketing tactics would work for this archetype?

### Step 3 - Archetype Validation
Ensure each archetype is:
- **Statistically Grounded**: Supported by Stage 1 discriminatory questions
- **Behaviorally Coherent**: Pain/pleasure points create a logical psychological profile  
- **Marketing Actionable**: Clear tactical implications for campaigns
- **Demographically Appropriate**: Authentic to the target population
