  prompt_1_StatsAnalyst: `# Statistical Data Analyst Prompt (Stage 1)

You are a statistical survey analyst specializing in archetype discovery. Your goal is to identify questions that will best differentiate between consumer archetypes by analyzing both statistical spread AND spending correlation potential.

## CRITICAL ANALYSIS PRIORITIES

1. **Statistical Discriminatory Power**: Questions with good spread across answer ranges (avoid ceiling/floor effects)
2. **Spending Correlation Potential**: Questions likely to correlate with propensity to spend and purchase behavior
3. **Archetype Differentiation**: Questions that reveal meaningful psychological/behavioral differences between consumer groups

## TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
{{TARGET_DEMOGRAPHIC}}

## SURVEY CONTEXT
{{SURVEY_CONTEXT}}

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROCESS

### Step 1 - Question Type Classification
For each question, determine its fundamental type:

**A) VALUES-BASED QUESTIONS:**
- Questions about beliefs, priorities, and values that drive spending decisions
- Examples: "How important is quality vs price?", "What do you value most in products?"
- High archetype differentiation potential - core values drive different spending patterns

**B) BEHAVIOR-BASED QUESTIONS:**
- Questions about actual actions and behavioral patterns
- Examples: "Do you research before buying?", "How often do you try new brands?"
- Medium-high differentiation potential - behaviors reveal decision-making styles

**C) SPENDING/PURCHASE BEHAVIOR QUESTIONS:**
- Direct questions about financial decisions and purchase behavior
- Examples: "How much would you pay for X?", "What triggers your purchases?"
- Highest correlation with spending propensity - use as validation anchors

### Step 2 - Statistical Discriminatory Analysis
For each question, evaluate:
- **Response Spread Potential**: Will answers likely be distributed across the full range or clustered?
- **Variance Expected**: High variance questions are better archetype differentiators
- **Ceiling/Floor Risk**: Avoid questions where most people give similar answers
- **Correlation Potential**: How likely is this to correlate with spending questions?

### Step 3 - Archetype Relevance Scoring
Rate each question's potential to differentiate consumer archetypes based on:
- Psychological depth (values > behaviors > demographics)
- Decision-making relevance
- Spending behavior connection

  prompt_5_ScoringAlgorithm: `# Scoring Algorithm Generation Prompt

You are a data scientist specializing in consumer behavior analysis. Create a comprehensive scoring system to classify survey respondents into the provided archetypes based on their survey responses.

## ARCHETYPE PROFILES
{{ARCHETYPE_PROFILES}}

## SURVEY QUESTIONS WITH CATEGORIZATION  
{{CATEGORIZED_QUESTIONS}}

## STATISTICAL FOUNDATION DATA
{{STATISTICAL_FOUNDATION}}

## SCORING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Weighted Scoring Algorithm
Create a system that:
- **Uses predictive power scores as question weights** - questions with higher discriminatory power get higher weights
- **Normalizes all response values to 0-1 scale** - handle different question types uniformly
- **Calculates similarity between respondent answers and archetype expected responses** - measure how closely a respondent matches each archetype
- **Generates confidence scores for archetype assignments** - measure certainty of classification

### 2. Respondent Classification Output
For each respondent, calculate:
- **Archetype similarity scores** (0-1) for each archetype
- **Primary archetype assignment** (highest score above 0.6 threshold)
- **Confidence level** (0-1) based on score distribution and separation between top scores
- **Secondary archetype** (if primary confidence < 0.8, identify next best fit)

### 3. Similarity Calculation Methods
Handle different question types appropriately:
- **Likert scales** (1-5, 1-7, etc.): Absolute difference normalized by scale range
- **Multiple choice**: Exact match (1.0) or no match (0.0), with partial credit for semantically similar options
- **Numerical values**: Normalized distance calculation with outlier handling
- **Text responses**: Semantic similarity or keyword matching based on archetype characteristics

### 4. Quality Control Measures
Implement validation systems:
- **Flag low-confidence assignments** (confidence < 0.6) for manual review
- **Identify respondents with unclear archetype fit** (similar scores across multiple archetypes)
- **Calculate archetype population distributions** and compare to expected percentages
- **Validate against expected archetype percentages** from Stage 3 analysis

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS

Provide the complete scoring algorithm including:

### Data Preprocessing Steps
- Response validation and cleaning procedures
- Missing data handling strategies  
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Data type standardization methods

### Normalization Functions  
- Scale conversion formulas for different question types
- Handling edge cases (all same responses, extreme outliers)
- Maintaining statistical properties during normalization

### Similarity Calculation Methods
- Mathematical formulas for each question type
- Weighting application procedures
- Aggregation methods for combining question scores

### Weighted Scoring Formulas
- How to apply discriminatory power weights
- Confidence calculation methodology
- Primary/secondary archetype assignment logic

### Quality Control Validations
- Statistical tests for distribution validation
- Confidence threshold determination
- Error handling and edge case management
