# Universal Survey Digital Twins Pipeline Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive, generic pipeline to ingest any consumer survey data, categorize questions using Claude Opus 4.1, dynamically create population-specific archetypes, and build digital twin personas for targeted marketing responses. The system uses proven frameworks like LOHAS as reference points while allowing Claude Opus to generate contextually appropriate archetypes for any target demographic (mothers, retirees, teens, professionals, etc.).

function calculateArchetypeScore(response, archetype) {
    let totalScore = 0;
    let weightSum = 0;
    
    for (let question of archetype.keyQuestions) {
        const responseValue = response[question.id];
        const weight = question.predictivePower;
        const similarity = calculateSimilarity(responseValue, archetype.expectedResponse[question.id]);
        
        totalScore += similarity * weight;
        weightSum += weight;
    }
    
    return totalScore / weightSum;
}
```

### 6.3 Classification Process
1. **Score calculation**: Calculate archetype scores for each response
2. **Assignment**: Assign to highest-scoring archetype (minimum threshold 0.6)
3. **Confidence measurement**: Calculate confidence based on score distribution
4. **Validation**: Flag uncertain classifications for review

### 10.1 3-Stage Specialized Prompt Architecture
All LLM prompts are centralized in `src/prompts/universal-survey-prompts.js` with specialized roles:

```javascript
/**
 * Universal Survey Digital Twins - 3-Stage Specialized LLM Prompt Templates
 * 
 * STAGE 1: Statistical Data Analyst - Discriminatory questions & spending correlation
 * STAGE 2: Behavioral Statistician - Evidence-based pain/pleasure point analysis  
 * STAGE 3: Marketing Expert - Evidence-based archetype creation with data lineage
 */

// 3-Stage Specialized Analysis Pipeline
export const STATISTICAL_DATA_ANALYST_PROMPT = (targetDemographic, surveyContext, questionsList, responseData) => {...};
export const BEHAVIORAL_STATISTICIAN_PROMPT = (discriminatoryQuestions, spendingCorrelations, correlationMatrix) => {...};
export const MARKETING_EXPERT_PROMPT = (statisticalAnalysis, painPleasurePoints, demographicContext) => {...};

// Enhanced Digital Twin with Pain/Pleasure Integration
export const EVIDENCE_BASED_DIGITAL_TWIN_PROMPT = (archetype, painPleasureProfile, statisticalFoundation) => {...};

// Export collection for 3-stage pipeline
export const THREE_STAGE_SURVEY_PROMPTS = {
  stage1_statisticalAnalyst: STATISTICAL_DATA_ANALYST_PROMPT,
  stage2_behavioralStatistician: BEHAVIORAL_STATISTICIAN_PROMPT,
  stage3_marketingExpert: MARKETING_EXPERT_PROMPT,
  evidenceBasedDigitalTwin: EVIDENCE_BASED_DIGITAL_TWIN_PROMPT
};
```

### 9.2 Usage Throughout System
Components import and use the centralized prompts:

```javascript
// In question categorizer
import { QUESTION_CATEGORIZATION_PROMPT } from '../prompts/universal-survey-prompts.js';
const prompt = QUESTION_CATEGORIZATION_PROMPT(targetDemographic, surveyContext, questionsList);

// In archetype generator
import { ARCHETYPE_GENERATION_PROMPT } from '../prompts/universal-survey-prompts.js';
const prompt = ARCHETYPE_GENERATION_PROMPT(demographicAnalysis, questionTypesText, patternsText, statistics);

// In digital twin response API
import { DIGITAL_TWIN_RESPONSE_PROMPT } from '../prompts/universal-survey-prompts.js';
const prompt = DIGITAL_TWIN_RESPONSE_PROMPT(archetype, dataset, demographicAnalysis);
```

### 9.3 Key Benefits
- **Easy Editing**: All prompts in one location for quick modifications
- **Version Control**: Track prompt changes and their impact on results
- **Consistency**: Ensures all components use the same prompt versions
- **Modularity**: Functions accept parameters for dynamic content insertion
- **Maintenance**: Single point of truth for all LLM interactions

### 9.4 Two-Step Question Categorization
The updated categorization system uses a systematic two-step approach:

**Step 1 - Fundamental Type Classification:**
- `VALUES_BASED`: Questions about beliefs, priorities, and values
- `BEHAVIOR_BASED`: Questions about actions and behavioral patterns  
- `SPENDING_BASED`: Questions about financial decisions and purchase behavior

**Step 2 - Specific Theme Identification:**
Within each fundamental type, identify specific themes based on actual question content:
- Values: Health, Environment, Quality, Family, Security, etc.
- Behavior: Recommendation patterns, Usage frequency, Decision processes
- Spending: Price sensitivity, Purchase triggers, Budget allocation

### 9.5 Data-Driven Archetype Generation
The archetype generation system is completely unconstrained and data-driven:
- No predetermined frameworks imposed
- Natural clustering emerges from actual survey response patterns
- Authentic naming based on observed behaviors
- Reference frameworks only used when they naturally align with discovered patterns
