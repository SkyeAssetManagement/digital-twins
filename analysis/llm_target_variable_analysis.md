# LLM Target Variable Selection Analysis
## Current Prompts and Improvement Recommendations

**Date:** September 12, 2025  
**Analysis Focus:** Improving target variable detection to include brand preference and open-ended response analysis

---

## Current ROI Target Detection Prompt

### Existing Implementation

**Location:** `C:\code\digital-twins\src\analysis\roi-target-analyzer.js` - `buildROITargetPrompt` method

**Current Prompt:**
```
As a business analyst specializing in revenue optimization, identify the top 5 survey questions most likely to predict purchase intent, customer lifetime value, or revenue impact.

SURVEY CONTEXT:
Business: ${context.business_description || 'Consumer research'}
Target Market: ${context.target_demographic || 'General consumers'}
Dataset: ${context.dataset_name || 'Survey data'}

AVAILABLE SURVEY COLUMNS:
${columnList}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
Focus on identifying questions that predict:
1. Purchase intent or likelihood to buy
2. Spending amount or budget willingness
3. Customer lifetime value indicators
4. Conversion probability factors
5. Revenue-driving behaviors

For each identified ROI target, provide:
- column_name: Exact column name from the list
- roi_type: purchase_intent, spending_amount, customer_ltv, conversion_probability, or revenue_behavior
- business_impact_score: 0.0-1.0 score for revenue impact potential
- reasoning: Why this column predicts revenue outcomes
- ml_target_suitability: How suitable this is as an ML prediction target (0.0-1.0)

Respond with JSON array of target objects, ranked by business_impact_score (highest first).
```

### Issues with Current Approach

1. **Missing Brand Decision Factors:** The prompt doesn't explicitly look for brand preference questions or explanations of brand choices
2. **Overlooking Open-Ended Insights:** Essay-style responses that explain "why" are not prioritized as target variables
3. **Limited Category Focus:** Only focuses on financial/behavioral metrics, missing values-based and brand-loyalty indicators
4. **No Cross-Reference Detection:** Doesn't identify questions that reference other questions (Q9a → Q9 linkage)

## Analysis of Missing Target Variables

### Key Missing Questions from Detail Parents Survey

**Q120: "You chose to spend your $100 on [XX]. Please say why you chose that brand:"**
- **Type:** Open-ended brand preference explanation
- **Why It's Important:** Direct brand selection reasoning
- **Target Variable Potential:** High - explains actual purchase decision drivers
- **Current Status:** Not detected as target variable

**Q19a: "You indicated that you preferred other brands. Please indicate which brands you prefer and the reasons why."**
- **Type:** Open-ended brand preference with reasoning
- **Why It's Important:** Brand switching behavior and competitive analysis
- **Target Variable Potential:** High - reveals brand loyalty barriers
- **Current Status:** Not detected as target variable

### Why These Questions Are Critical

1. **Direct Purchase Decision Insight:** These questions capture the actual reasoning behind brand choices
2. **Brand Loyalty Indicators:** They reveal both positive brand affinity and competitive threats
3. **Values-Based Decision Making:** Often contain insights about values, quality, price, and health considerations
4. **Predictive Power:** Brand preference reasoning is highly predictive of future purchase behavior

## LLM Categorization of Open-Ended Responses

### Current Status Investigation

**Location to Check:** Semantic analysis components in `src/semantic/` and `src/analysis/`

### Existing Capabilities

Based on the codebase analysis, the system appears to have:
1. **Semantic Response Engine** - Handles sentiment analysis and purchase intent scoring
2. **Advanced Semantic Engine** - More sophisticated response categorization
3. **Integrated Persona Engines** - Multiple versions for response processing

### Missing Capabilities for Open-Ended Brand Analysis

**Need for Brand Choice Categorization:**
```javascript
// Proposed enhancement for open-ended brand response analysis
const brandChoiceCategories = {
  values_based: ["natural", "organic", "ethical", "sustainable", "cruelty-free"],
  quality_based: ["effective", "gentle", "safe", "clinically-tested", "dermatologist-approved"],
  price_based: ["affordable", "value", "budget", "cost-effective", "good deal"],
  brand_based: ["trusted", "reliable", "familiar", "recommended", "experience"],
  health_based: ["sensitive skin", "hypoallergenic", "no chemicals", "gentle formula"]
}
```

---

## Semantic Category Enhancement

### Current Categories (Found in Analysis)
- **PRICE:** Price sensitivity and deal-seeking
- **VALUES:** Ethical and value-based preferences  
- **QUALITY:** Product quality and safety
- **HEALTH:** Health and safety concerns
- **OTHER:** Miscellaneous factors

### Proposed Enhanced Categories

```javascript
const enhancedSemanticCategories = {
  // Core Business Categories
  PRICE: ["affordable", "budget", "cost", "deal", "promotion", "value"],
  BRAND: ["trust", "loyalty", "familiarity", "reputation", "experience", "recommendation"],
  VALUES: ["ethical", "sustainable", "cruelty-free", "vegan", "australian-made", "environmental"],
  QUALITY: ["effective", "safe", "gentle", "clinical", "dermatologist", "pediatrician"],
  HEALTH: ["organic", "natural", "hypoallergenic", "sensitive", "eczema", "chemical-free"],
  
  // Behavioral Categories
  CONVENIENCE: ["available", "accessible", "easy", "simple", "time-saving"],
  SOCIAL: ["recommended", "referral", "word-of-mouth", "family", "friends"],
  
  // Decision Process Categories  
  RESEARCH_BASED: ["ingredients", "reviews", "comparison", "analysis"],
  EMOTION_BASED: ["feel", "confidence", "worry", "concern", "satisfaction"],
  EXPERIENCE_BASED: ["tried", "used", "worked", "results", "effectiveness"]
}
```
