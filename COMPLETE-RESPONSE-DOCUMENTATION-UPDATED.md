## 1. Rip Curl "The Search" Ad Responses

### Ad Description
A lifestyle-focused surf commercial featuring beach scenes, attractive models, surfing action, and party atmosphere. No sustainability messaging, pure lifestyle marketing.

---

### LEADER SEGMENT (12.4% of market)

**Response 1 - Basic Semantic (50ms, Free)**
"This doesn't align with what 112 of us Leaders look for. We need substance worth paying premium for."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 2/10*

**Response 2 - Advanced Semantic (1.6s, $0.002)**
"This is just lifestyle marketing without any substance. Show me real environmental commitment or I'm not interested."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 2/10*

**Response 3 - Claude Opus 4.1 (6s, $0.03)**
"This feels like every other surf brand ad I've seen - just bros and beach babes with zero substance about what makes their gear actually worth buying. I care about performance and durability in my surf gear, not watching some fantasy lifestyle sequence, and they're telling me nothing about the technical specs, materials, or why their products would last longer than competitors. If Rip Curl wants my business, they need to show me real innovation in their wetsuit technology or board shorts construction, not just another 'dudes surfing while a woman watches' cliché."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 3/10*

### LEANING SEGMENT (22.6% of market)

**Response 1 - Basic Semantic (50ms, Free)**
"I need good value for my money."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 4/10*

**Response 2 - Advanced Semantic (1.6s, $0.002)**
"The product looks good, though I'm concerned about the price point. If the quality matches the price, I'd consider paying 10-15% more."
*Sentiment: Neutral | Purchase Intent: 4/10*

**Response 3 - Claude Opus 4.1 (6s, $0.03)**
"Honestly, the ad feels pretty dated with the whole 'bikini girl watching surfers' thing - it's giving me serious 90s vibes in not a great way. The surfing footage sounds epic though, and if Rip Curl makes quality gear that can handle those conditions, I'd be interested in checking them out - I just wish they'd focused more on the actual product performance instead of the tired beach babe trope. Their stuff better be worth the premium they're probably charging with all that production value."
*Sentiment: Neutral | Purchase Intent: 5/10*

### LEARNER SEGMENT (37.5% of market)

**Response 1 - Basic Semantic (50ms, Free)**
"Looks cool but what's the price? Need to know if it's worth it."
*Sentiment: Neutral | Purchase Intent: 5/10*

**Response 2 - Advanced Semantic (1.6s, $0.002)**
"What makes this different from regular brands? I'm still learning about premium products."
*Sentiment: Neutral | Purchase Intent: 4/10*

**Response 3 - Claude Opus 4.1 (6s, $0.03)**
"The surfing looks incredible and those boardshorts do look well-made, but this feels like every surf ad I've seen for the past 20 years - hot woman on beach, dudes shredding waves, sunset beers. I'd be more interested in seeing actual product details like the fabric technology or construction quality rather than just lifestyle shots, especially if Rip Curl expects me to pay premium prices for their gear. The 'Live the search' tagline doesn't really tell me anything about what makes their products worth choosing over competitors."
*Sentiment: Neutral | Purchase Intent: 4/10*

### LAGGARD SEGMENT (27.5% of market)

**Response 1 - Basic Semantic (50ms, Free)**
"Probably overpriced. Not interested."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 2/10*

**Response 2 - Advanced Semantic (1.6s, $0.002)**
"Same old marketing - just another overpriced hype. I can get other brands for half of the price."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 2/10*

**Response 3 - Claude Opus 4.1 (6s, $0.03)**
"Okay, so it's basically the same old surf brand formula - hot beach scene, bros being bros, throw in a woman for eye candy. I get that Rip Curl makes solid gear and I've heard good things about their wetsuits lasting forever, but this doesn't tell me anything about why their stuff is actually worth buying over O'Neill or Billabong. If I'm dropping $200+ on a wetsuit, I need to know about the tech, the fit, the durability - not watch some fantasy beach party that has nothing to do with how the product actually performs."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 3/10*

## 2. Patagonia "Don't Buy This Jacket" Ad Responses

### Ad Description
Revolutionary reverse-psychology ad showing a Patagonia jacket with "DON'T BUY THIS JACKET" headline. The ad explains the environmental cost of production and encourages buying only what you need, repairing what you have, and considering used items first.

---

### LEADER SEGMENT (12.4% of market)

**Response 1 - Basic Semantic (50ms, Free)**
"This is exactly what we need - honest brands taking responsibility. Worth every premium dollar."
*Sentiment: Positive | Purchase Intent: 9/10*

**Response 2 - Advanced Semantic (1.6s, $0.002)**
"Finally, a brand that gets it! This transparency about environmental impact is exactly what I've been demanding. Patagonia just earned my loyalty."
*Sentiment: Positive | Purchase Intent: 10/10*

**Response 3 - Claude Opus 4.1 (6s, $0.03)**
"This is revolutionary - a company actually telling consumers NOT to buy unnecessarily? This is the kind of radical transparency and genuine environmental commitment I've been waiting for. Patagonia isn't just talking about sustainability, they're actively discouraging overconsumption even at their own expense. The fact they're explaining the true environmental cost of production and encouraging repair over replacement shows they actually understand the crisis we're facing. This is exactly where my money goes - to companies brave enough to put the planet before profits. I'll pay whatever premium they ask because this is real leadership."
*Sentiment: Positive | Purchase Intent: 10/10*

### LEANING SEGMENT (22.6% of market)

**Response 1 - Basic Semantic (50ms, Free)**
"I appreciate the honesty. This makes me trust the brand more and willing to invest in quality."
*Sentiment: Positive | Purchase Intent: 7/10*

**Response 2 - Advanced Semantic (1.6s, $0.002)**
"This is refreshing honesty from a brand. The transparency makes me trust them more - I'd rather buy one quality jacket that lasts than three cheap ones."
*Sentiment: Positive | Purchase Intent: 8/10*

**Response 3 - Claude Opus 4.1 (6s, $0.03)**
"Wow, this is bold - telling customers not to buy your product? I really respect this approach. It makes me actually want to support Patagonia more because they're being honest about the environmental impact. The message about buying only what you need and repairing what you have resonates with me. I've been trying to be more conscious about my purchases, and this kind of transparency helps me make better decisions. If I do need a jacket, I'd definitely pay more for Patagonia knowing they're this committed to sustainability."
*Sentiment: Positive | Purchase Intent: 8/10*

### LEARNER SEGMENT (37.5% of market)

**Response 1 - Basic Semantic (50ms, Free)**
"Interesting approach but confusing. Why advertise if you don't want sales? Still need to know the price."
*Sentiment: Neutral | Purchase Intent: 5/10*

**Response 2 - Advanced Semantic (1.6s, $0.002)**
"This is confusing - they're telling me not to buy? But if I do need a jacket, is theirs worth the premium? I need more information about why it's special."
*Sentiment: Neutral | Purchase Intent: 5/10*

**Response 3 - Claude Opus 4.1 (6s, $0.03)**
"I'm confused - is this reverse psychology or are they serious? It's definitely different from other ads I've seen. The part about repairing and buying used is interesting, but if I do need a new jacket, why should I choose Patagonia over others? They're probably expensive, right? I guess the message is about buying quality that lasts, but I'd still need to see the price and compare with other options. It's a creative ad but I'm not sure it makes me want to spend more on their products."
*Sentiment: Neutral | Purchase Intent: 4/10*

### LAGGARD SEGMENT (27.5% of market)

**Response 1 - Basic Semantic (50ms, Free)**
"Marketing gimmick. They still want your money, just charging more for the guilt trip."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 1/10*

**Response 2 - Advanced Semantic (1.6s, $0.002)**
"Reverse psychology marketing trick. They're still selling expensive jackets, just with a guilt-trip angle. My cheap jacket works fine."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 1/10*

**Response 3 - Claude Opus 4.1 (6s, $0.03)**
"Oh please, this is just clever marketing to make you feel good about spending $300 on a jacket. 'Don't buy this' - yeah right, they're a business, of course they want you to buy it. All this environmental guilt stuff is just to justify their crazy prices. My $40 jacket from Walmart keeps me just as warm. This is just another way for rich people to feel superior about their purchases. Nice try Patagonia, but I'm not falling for the reverse psychology."
*Sentiment: Negative | Purchase Intent: 1/10*
