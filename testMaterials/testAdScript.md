(0-5 seconds)

Music: Upbeat, slightly distorted surf rock with a driving beat.

(25-45 seconds)

Visuals: Epic surfing action. Huge aerials, deep barrel rides, and massive turns. The camera captures the spray flying off the waves and the intensity in the surfers' eyes.

(45-55 seconds)

Visuals: The surfers are back on the beach, exhausted but exhilarated. They're sitting on their boards, watching the sunset. The woman from the beginning of the ad approaches them and offers them a beer. They all cheer and take a drink.

(55-60 seconds)

Visuals: A final, epic shot of a surfer riding a massive wave.
